## CI CD PIPELINES USING AWS
●	The continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is an automated approach to streamline the development and deployment process, allowing teams to deliver high-quality software efficiently.
●	AWS offers a suite of services that facilitate the implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline, including AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodeCommit

## About
●	AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Secrets Manager ensure that sensitive data, such as credentials, is handled securely throughout the pipeline. Additionally, monitoring and logging tools like Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail provide real-time visibility into pipeline performance and security compliance.
●	In modern software engineering, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines play a critical role in accelerating development cycles while ensuring code stability. AWS offers an array of cloud-native tools to implement scalable and secure CI/CD pipelines.
●	These services enable developers to automate the build, test, and deployment phases of the software lifecycle. AWS CodePipeline orchestrates the entire process, integrating with CodeBuild for compiling source code, CodeDeploy for managing deployments, and CodeCommit for version control. 
●	Additionally, AWS services like Lambda, EC2, and ECS can be used to deploy applications across various environments. The scalability, security, and reliability of AWS infrastructure make it a powerful platform for CI/CD practices. 

## Features
Automated Code Integration (CI): Automatically merges code changes, using services like AWS CodeCommit, ensuring compatibility and reducing integration issues.

Automated Testing: Runs unit and integration tests using AWS CodeBuild, identifying bugs early in the development cycle.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Deploys applications to staging or production automatically with AWS CodeDeploy, minimizing manual intervention.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manages infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation templates, ensuring consistent environments across deployments.

Version Control Integration: Supports Git-based repositories like GitHub and AWS CodeCommit for tracking code versions and collaboration.
Monitoring & Logging: Integrates with AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and logging, enabling proactive issue detection.

Security & Compliance: Incorporates AWS IAM and security policies to control access, ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.

## Requirements
AWS Account: An active AWS account with appropriate service permissions, enabling access to CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and other CI/CD services.

Source Code Repository: A repository like AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or Bitbucket to store and manage source code versions for continuous integration.

Build Environment: A configured environment in AWS CodeBuild with necessary runtime, libraries, and tools to compile and test the application.

Deployment Environment: A target environment, such as EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or ECS, where the application will be deployed, ensuring proper infrastructure for each deployment.

IAM Roles and Permissions: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with specific permissions for pipeline services, controlling who can build, test, and deploy.

Automated Test Scripts: Unit and integration test scripts to ensure new changes meet quality standards before deployment.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Configuration files, such as CloudFormation or Terraform templates, to manage infrastructure consistently across environment

## Results and Impact
Faster Release Cycles: Automated build, test, and deployment processes reduce time-to-market for new features and bug fixes, helping teams release updates more frequently.

Improved Code Quality: Continuous integration and testing identify issues early, resulting in cleaner, more reliable code and reducing errors in production.

Enhanced Team Collaboration: CI/CD pipelines streamline team workflows, allowing developers, testers, and operations to work in sync and reducing bottlenecks.

Cost Efficiency: Automation and infrastructure as code reduce manual effort and operational costs, allowing resources to be used more effectively.

Reduced Downtime: Continuous deployment allows for smoother rollouts, with quick rollback options, minimizing application downtime in case of issues.

Scalability and Flexibility: AWS allows on-demand scaling of resources based on workload, enabling efficient handling of large builds and deployments.

Improved Security: With integrated security checks and compliance monitoring, CI/CD on AWS helps in identifying vulnerabilities before production, enhancing application security.
